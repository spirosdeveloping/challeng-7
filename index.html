   <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
   in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>

  <p class="D-paragraph">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
   transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
   for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
   The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
   the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

  <h3 class="j">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h3>

  <p class="j-paragraph">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
  for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

<h3 class=" Awesome">  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
  learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>

  <p class="patrick-paragraph">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

  <h3 class="such">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>

  <p class="kira-paragraph">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
  100% recommend! ”</p>
